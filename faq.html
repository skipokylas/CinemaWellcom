                    <li class="q">What is CinemaWell.com?</li>
                    <li class="a">CinemaWell.com is social network of online cinemas which pays its movie-goers for fun and entertainment in its cryptocurrency, ApplauseCash (APLC). The platform also lets anyone open a cinema, load online content there (e.g., a movie), send out tickets to an unlimited number of people, chat with viewers while watching movies, get feedback, watch movies with “strangers”, meet new friends and much more. and watch:
                        <a href=" https://youtu.be/c7Dq6KO9lJU"> video</a> In addition, the InVision prototype for the new 2.0 CinemaWell.com is available at:<a href="https://youtu.be/7HbO9w6PlxA">video</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">Why is CinemaWell.com important?</li>
                    <li class="a">Currently, the most used platform available for any content and film makers to their share video content is YouTube. CinemaWell.com provides a much more user-friendly platform with far superior functionality. It is a win-win platform, providing many benefits to movie-makers and movie-goers. First, of course, a whole new world of entertainment is open to viewers. In addition to the obvious viewing pleasure, users are paid for viewing films using cryptocurrenty, named ApplauseCash (APLC). Last but not least, the platform offers great valuable marketing data analytics for filmmakers!
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">What makes CinemaWell.com platform different from YouTube?</li>
                    <li class="a">From a viewer’s perspective, now you watch online content and get paid! From film-maker’s perspective, when movies are viewed on YouTube, the only metric available is number of views. CinemaWell.com offers much more valuable marketing data. Filmmakers will see all members of the viewing audience, and will be able to save these users’ information for inviting them to give feedback about the film and view future films as well. This will be a convenient tool for growing the filmmakers’ business, as they can analyze their audience, obtain feedback from them, and invite them to view future films as well.</li>
                    <li class="q"> Is there beta version of the product?
                    </li>

                    <li class="q">What is Internet Video Co-Viewing (IVCV)?</li>
                    <li class="a">Internet Video Co-Viewing (IVCV) is a new way of distributing video, which allows an unlimited number of online users to gather together and view the same video content in one virtual theater at the same time. Anyone who creates video content and uses IVCV is able to see and have access to the online profiles of each viewer. This helps to get more information about audiences, to create analytics, and to foster team building for users with the same interests.</li>
                    <li class="q">What types of accounts does CinemaWell.com have?</li>

The platform also lets any user open his own online cinema and load any unlicensed video content there, all for free. If the cinema owner does not own the copyright to the content he shares (e.g., the user copies content from YouTube), owner of the cinema is assigned a basic account, and the price of the tickets will always be $0.
                        <br><b> Pro Account:</b> However, if a cinema owner is a film-maker (or a person who has purchased the copyright to video content), he will specify this content ownership when he loads film. At this point, he will be assigned a pro-account. This means that he can sell tickets for any price he chooses, also to unlimited number of movie-goers.
