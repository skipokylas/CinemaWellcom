                    <li class="a"><b>Basic Account:</b> All CinemaWell.com users can purchase tickets (many for free) and watch films online. The platform also lets any user open his own online cinema and load any unlicensed video content there, all for free. If the cinema owner does not own the copyright to the content he shares (e.g., the user copies content from YouTube), owner of the cinema is assigned a basic account, and the price of the tickets will always be $0.
                        <br><b> Pro Account:</b> However, if a cinema owner is a film-maker (or a person who has purchased the copyright to video content), he will specify this content ownership when he loads film. At this point, he will be assigned a pro-account. This means that he can sell tickets for any price he chooses, also to unlimited number of movie-goers. All prices will be paid in cryptocurrency, Applause Cash (APLC). Watch more at: <a href="https://youtu.be/nFUz9sqn6oM">video</a> </li>

                    <li class="q">What would increase the value of the ApplauseCash?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <br> ApplauseCash has a finite circulation of only 300 million. Our business plan requires that no more will be released. Almost half is allotted for uses inside the platform for payment to watch movies, leave feedback, etc. After viewers are paid for watching movies, we'll do our best to encourage them to use their earnings for various micro-payment opportunities, like dating features, buying spotlight seats in the cinemas, and so on. The value of ApplauseCash will depend on the market, our platform popularity, number of users, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br> We are going to participate in the Cannes, Hong Kong, and Berlin film festivals where we'll introduce CinemaWell.com to many producers/filmmakers and possibly purchase rights for various films to premiere on CinemaWell.com version 2 (planned for release at the end of 2018 April). The more users we attract by paying them for watching movies, the higher value of ApplauseCash could be. This is one factor which drives the future value of ApplauseCash.
                        <br>
                        <br>We do have a plan to increase value over time.

                    </li>
                    <li class="q">What happens to unsold ApplauseCash (below hard cap)?
                        <br> Will you sell it?</li>
                    <li class="a">Unsold ApplauseCash (under ICO hard cap) will be allotted to future rewards for watching movies, leaving feedback, etc., and not sold.
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">Will ApplauseCash be traded on an exchange?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        We have already started negotiating with the market/exchange platforms and and with stocks of crypto assets. It is not possible to get them on an exchange until some time after the ICO is completed.
                        <br> Our team includes an experienced trader with over 15 years of experience in trading (the last 7 years in crypto trading). He intends to make this happen.
